**PhD Student at the Tübingen AI Center**

I am a PhD student at [Bethgelab](https://bethgelab.org/) at the [Tübingen AI Center](https://tuebingen.ai/u) of the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/). Before, I obtained a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science from the University of Münster, followed by a second Master's degree in Machine Learning at the University of Tübingen (GPA of 1.0/1.0 each).

I have a broad interest in the current developments of foundation models. So far, my publications were connected to Scalable Oversight of LLMs, Reinforce-Learning post-training with dense, intrinsic reward and Information Seeking in Long-Horizon Interactions. Apart from those topics, I am interested in anything related to post-training and reasoning LLMs, decoding strategies, latent reasoning, and world models.

In my free time, I frequently play badminton and infrequently do other sports such as recurve archery, bouldering, road cycling, skiing, kayaking, volleyball, ... I enjoy hiking, camping, cinema, reading, gardening, and life-long learning. When I find the time, I like to indulge myself in the hedonistic joys life has to offer: cooking, baking, tea & coffee.

Our world is amazing, but our days are too short.
